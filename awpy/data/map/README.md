## Map Data (Images & Coordinates)

The files that contain the `x`, `y`, and `scale` values for each map will be in your `.../steamapps/common/Counter-Strike Global Offensive/csgo/resource/overviews/...` folder. They are named like `[map_name].txt`. You should see a row with `pos_x`, `pos_y`, and `scale` in the text file. Update the `map_data.json` file with those values, keeping with the same style as the other entries.

### Updating the Map Images

SimpleRadar backgrounds can be found [here](https://readtldr.gg/simpleradar). SimpleRadar files used with permission. Get SimpleRadar [here](https://readtldr.gg/simpleradar).


#### Option 1

Create the map files using instructions found in [@zoidbergwill/csgo-overviews](https://github.com/zoidbergwill/csgo-overviews). This is how the backgrounds were initially created.

#### Option 2

Load the `.dds` file that can be found in the `...//steamapps/common/Counter-Strike Global Offensive/csgo/resource/overviews/...` folder into an image editing program like GIMP and export as a `.png`.

#### Option 3

Use an online converter on the `.dds` file that can be found in the `.../steamapps/common/Counter-Strike Global Offensive/csgo/resource/overviews/...` folder like [https://convertio.co/dds-png/](https://convertio.co/dds-png/).
