    "Counter-Strike 2 (CS2) games can be recorded through a _demofile_. Every map in a match will generate its own demofile. This demofile contains a serialization of the data transferred between the host (game server) and its clients (players). Data transferred to and from the server occurs at a predefined tick rate, which defines when client inputs are resolved with the server. For professional games, the server tick rate is usually 128 ticks per second, meaning each tick represents around 7.8 milliseconds. Client inputs represent player actions, such as movement, attacks or grenade throws. Non-client events also register in the demofile, such as round starts and ends. Awpy allows you to parse the rich data that exists within CS2 demofiles."
