    "# Calculating Visibility in Counter-Strike 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculating visibility is a bit difficult for a variety of reasons. You may want to use the `isSpotted` flag that has long been in Counter-Strike demos. However, it is known to be unreliable. We can flip the problem of visibility by doing some basic geometrical calculations. At the simplest level, we can see if a line segment between two points intersects any part of the map. Now, this is clearly not 100% foolproof, as smokes can obscure vision or a player's head position can even change visibility, but it is a start.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, you need to acquire the Universal Scene Description (USD) files by running `awpy get usd`. You can see how we create USDs by visiting [here](https://awpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usd.html). The interface for calculating is very simple. Below, we show some examples of visibility calculations in Dust 2. If you want to check positions in a local server, you can set `sv_cheats 1` and then type `getpos` in your game's console."
