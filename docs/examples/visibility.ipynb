    "# Calculating Visibility in Counter-Strike 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowing whether or not two players are visible to each other opens up exciting analysis opportunities. It is also somewhat difficult to calculate, and existing in game flags like `isSpotted` can be unreliable. Awpy provides a fast approach to determining visibility in Counter-Strike 2 (CS2). While our approach is not 100% foolproof, it is a start and applicable in many cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Triangles are the fundamental building blocks of 3D models, including those used in Counter-Strike maps. In computer graphics, complex surfaces are often broken down into smaller, flat polygons, typically triangles, because they are computationally efficient to render and manipulate. A Counter-Strike map consists of many such triangles forming walls, floors, objects, and other geometry. These triangles are used not only for visual rendering but also for collision detection and gameplay mechanics, such as determining visibility and movement constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "To determine if two points are visible, our approach checks whether the straight line segment connecting them intersects with any of the triangles in the map. This process involves representing the map's triangles in a bounding volume hierarchy (BVH) tree, which organizes the triangles into nested groups to optimize intersection tests. The algorithm first queries the BVH to quickly identify potential collision candidates. Then, it performs precise intersection tests between the line segment and the relevant triangles. If no intersection is found, the points are visible to each other; otherwise, they are not. This approach balances accuracy and performance, making it suitable for real-time applications in games."

    "### Acquiring `.tri` files\n",
    "Awpy parses CS2 maps and produces `.tri` files, which are binary files containing the triangle information. Across all maps, the compressed `.tri` files are about 20 megabytes, so they are ultimately still quite small. To download the `.tri` files to your awpy data directory, you can run `awpy get tris` to get the relevant files. Below, we show where the files are located."
